Despite progress in education, gender disparities still exist in various provinces of Cambodia. 
The lower representation of girls in enrollment or higher repetition rates indicate inequality in access and success in education. 
Similarly, the percentage of female teachers can influence girlsâ€™ school participation and performance. 
This project uses machine learning techniques to identify provinces with the highest gender imbalance and predict key contributing factors.

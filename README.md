# 📊 Analyzing Cambodia's Education Data (2020–2021) Using Machine Learning

## 🧭 Project Overview
This project analyzes Cambodian education data (2020–2021) to extract insights and predict trends using machine learning. The goal is to support stakeholders—such as policymakers, NGOs, and educators—with data-driven decisions to improve the education system.

---

## 🧩 Societal or Industrial Impact
This work empowers education reform by identifying regional disparities and guiding effective allocation of educational resources across Cambodia.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Despite efforts to improve education, a lack of analytical tools makes it difficult to understand trends, infrastructure distribution, and outcomes across provinces.

---

## 🔍 Research Questions

- **What** disparities exist in educational access and resources?
- **Why** do certain regions show underperformance or infrastructure gaps?
- **How** can ML help in predicting and understanding education patterns?

---

## 🧠 Contributions

- Cleaned and prepared the Cambodia education dataset.
- Detected and handled missing values.
- Built machine learning models to extract insights and predict outcomes.
- Created a reproducible data analysis pipeline.

---

## 📦 Dataset

- **Type**: Secondary Dataset  
- **File**: `cambodia_education_2020_2021.csv`  
- **Source**: Public/open government data  
- **Description**: Includes number of schools, students, teachers, infrastructure, and geographic data by province.
